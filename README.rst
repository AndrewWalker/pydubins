Overview
========

This software finds the shortest paths between configurations for the Dubins' car [Dubins57]_, the forward only car-like vehicle with a constrained turning radius. A good description of the equations and basic strategies for doing this are described in section 15.3.1 `"Dubins Curves" <http://planning.cs.uiuc.edu/node821.html>`_ of the book "Planning Algorithms" [LaValle06]_.

The approach used to find paths is based on the algebraic solutions published in [Shkel01]_. However, rather than using angular symmetries to improve performance, the simpler approach to test all possible solutions is used here. 

This code is primarily a Cython wrapper of https://github.com/AndrewWalker/Dubins-Curves

Installing
==========

You can install the latest stable version from `PyPI <http://pypi.python.org/pypi/dubins>`_

.. code-block:: console

    $ pip install dubins

Or, you can install the latest development version from `GitHub <https://github.com/AndrewWalker/pydubins>`_

Example
=======

Sampling of a Dubin's path at finite size sizes

.. code-block:: python

    import dubins

    q0 = (x0, y0, theta0)
    q1 = (x1, y1, theta1)
    turning_radius = 1.0
    step_size = 0.5

    qs, _ = dubins.path_sample(q0, q1, turning_radius, step_size)
